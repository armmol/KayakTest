1. Calculate number frequency in a list

Given a list of integers A, print appearance frequency of each number in the list. Example:

A = [1, 4, 1, 5, 8, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 3, 7, 2]

Output:

Frequency: 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1

Number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8



Requirements

The program should be implemented in JAVA language.

The program should accept list A as an argument either in command line or in UI.

Numbers line should have all numbers from min(A) to max(A) even if it does not appear in A (e.g. 6) Numbers in the two lines should be aligned.

Bonus points:

Instead of printing the number of appearances, draw a graph similar to the one below.

Prepare JUnit tests to ensure good code quality.

Try keeping your code efficient and try to apply OOP (object oriented programming) principles:

The command line application solves the problem stated above by calculating frequencies of values in the list and displaying them on the number line using a 2D Array.
